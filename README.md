# Estimation of the Sample Covariance Matrix from Compressive Measurements
Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08887](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08887)

The program is an implementation of the above paper by *Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki* (2016). The `CovarianceMatrix` class provides a biased and an unbiased estimator as proposed by the author and compares their accuracies in predicting the original covariance matrix.

Note: The input matrix X in the estimator is assumed to be a zero mean distribution.
