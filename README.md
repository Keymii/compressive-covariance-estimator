# Estimation of the Sample Covariance Matrix from Compressive Measurements
The program is an implementation of the above paper by *Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki* (2016). The `CovarianceMatrix` class provides a biased and an unbiased estimator as proposed by the author and compares their accuracies in predicting the original covariance matrix.

Note: The input matrix X in the estimator is assumed to be a zero mean distribution.
